- What is spark
    - it open source
    - a parallel processing framework
    - developed predominantly using scala

- What is Scala
    - a high level programming language
    - supports functional style of programming
    - supports OO style of programming
    - it's actually a multi-paradigm language

- function programming
    - function style of programming inherently supports parallelism
    - function style of programming is not restricted to a particular programming language
    - it can be implemented in any language, just like the way OO concepts can also be implemented in programming language like C
    - certain programming language inherently support sunctional style of programming reducing the programmer's burden
    - scala is one of the functional programming language

- spark architecture
    - driver is the starting point of a job submission.
    - cluster manager can be compared to the resource manager in hadoop.
    - worker nodes are the data nodes in a HADOOP cluster.
    - the executor can be compared to that of a node manager in HADOOP 2 or task tracker in HADOOP 1.
    - driver (spark context) <->cluster manager <-> worker(executor)
                                                <-> worker(executor)
                                                <-> worker(executor)

- spark deployment modes
    - standaline (used for learning & developement)
        - this is very similar to the pseudo distributed mode of Hadoop 
        - Spark services run on multiple JVM's
        - This is also known as standalone cluster
    - local mode (used for learning & development)
        - there is a single JVM (no need of HDFS)
    - cluster mode (can work with MESOS or YARN)
        - used for production environment & it's fully distributed mode

- job execution in SPARK
