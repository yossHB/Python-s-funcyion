- data pipeline
    extracts all data through connections with several databases, transforms it using a cluster computing framework (hadoop/spark) and load it into an analytical database.
- tools to scheduled
    oozie / airflow
- Data processing is often very complicated because you have to manually distribute workload over several computers.
- PARTITION BY clause divides the rows of the table into different groups.
- types of analytic functions
    - Analytic aggregate functions
        - MIN() / MAX() / AVG() / SUM() / COUNT()
    - Analytic navigation functions
        - FIRST_VALUE() / LAST_VALUE()
    - Analytic numbering functions
        - ROW_NUMBER() / RANK()

Object–relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

- Cleaning :
    - Count missing data  : data.isnull().sum() # missing data points per column
    - Drop missing values : data.dropna()
    - Filling in missing values automatically : data.loc[:]
    - replace all NA's the value that comes directly after it in the same column,   subset_nfl_data.fillna(method='bfill', axis=0)
    - replace all the remaining na's with 0 : subset_nfl_data.fillna(method='bfill', axis=0).fillna(0)

- ERD : entity relationship diagram is a common way to view data in a database.

- Databases
    - Data integrity is ensured - only the data you want entered is entered, and only certain users are able to enter data into the database.
    - Data can be accessed quickly - SQL allows you to obtain results very quickly from the data stored in a database. Code can be optimized to quickly pull results.
    - Data is easily shared - multiple individuals can access data stored in a database, and the data is the same for all users allowing for consistent results for anyone with access to your database.

-  MySQL doesn’t have some of the functions for modifying dates as Postgres. 
- CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top'
     WHEN  SUM(total_amt_usd) > 100000 THEN 'middle'
     ELSE 'low' END AS customer_level
