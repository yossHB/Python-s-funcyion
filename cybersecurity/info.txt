◼ Cybersecurity
    - definitions
        - Cybersecurity is the application of technologies, processes and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks.
        - Cyberspace : Artifacts based/dependent on computer and communications technology.
        - Security attack : any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization or an individual
        - Security mechanism : a mechanism that implements functions designed to prevent, detect, or respond to a security attack
        - Security service : a service that enhances the security of data processing systems and information transfers
        - Alert: A message sent by attack detection tools (e.g., IDS) when they observe an attack
        - Vulnerability: a weakness that may be exploited to cause loss or harm
        - Threat: A possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability
        - Risk: an expectation of loss expressed as the probability that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability
        - Security Policy: A set of rules and practices that specify how a system or organization provides security services to protect sensitive and critical system resources

    - Attacks sophistication VS Intruder knowledge
        - The level of knowledge required by intruders is getting steadily lower.
        - the ability to perpetrate sophisticated attacks against the survivability of systems has increased.
        causes:
            - Explosion of computer and Internet availability
            - Increase in broadband availability in residential areas
            - Low priority of security for software developers
            - Difficulty patching vulnerabilities on all systems
            - GUI based tools that exploit known software vulnerabilities
            - Availability of malware authoring/editing tools
            - Introduction of tools that attempt to exploit multiple vulnerabilities
        - Examples of security attacks
            - Capture of network traffic
            - Identity forging as authorized user or end system
            - Exploitation of software bugs to corrupt data or make a server leak sensitive data
            - Use of compromised system as attack facility
            - Malware propagation (e.g., worms, backdoors)
            - Denial of Service to critical assets (e.g., shutdown EHR (Electronic Heath record) systems in e-health infrastructures)
            - Insider malice (deliberate insertion of malicious code, data leakage)
            - Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear station
                - A worm planted within Iranian nuclear facilities using a USB memory stick
            - WannaCry ransomware attack
                - is a crypto ransomware worm that attacks Windows PCs. It's a form of malware that can spread from PC to PC across networks and then once on a computer it can encrypt critical files.

                    - software attack surface
                        - application, utility, or operating system code
                    - Human attack surface
                        - personnel or outsiders
                - example :
                    - Open ports
                    - Services accessible through a firewall
                    - Code that processes incoming data, email, XML, office documents, etc.
                    - Interfaces and Web forms
                    - An employee with access to sensitive information vulnerable to a social engineering attack
            - Attack Vector
                - Is a path/method that an attacker use to gain access to a server, host, or network in order to deliver a malicious outcome, or gain access to sensitive data

    - Types of Attackers
        - Amateurs
            - Script kiddies with little or no skill
            - Using existing tools or instructions found online for attacks
        - Hackers - break into computers or networks to gain access
            - White hats    with permission
            - Gray hats     without permission
            - Black hats    without permission
        - Organized Hackers - organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists, and state-sponsored hackers.
            - Coordination
            - Tracing difficulty

        - Deception: threat to integrity
        - Masquerade forging identity), falsification (alter data), repudiation
        - Disruption: threat to integrity and availability
        - Incapacitation (destruction of assets), corruption (alter system function by backdoor logic), obstruction (overload a system operation)
        - Usurpation: threat to integrity
        - Misappropriation (unauthorized contrôl of system resource), misuse (hacker gaining unauthorized access)

    - Active attacks versus passive attacks
        - Passive attacks : the cryptanalyst cannot interact with any of the parties involved, attempting to break the system solely based upon observed data.
            - 

        - Active attacks : is a network exploit in which a hacker attempts to make changes to data on the target or data en route to the target.

    -sniffing
        - Passive
            -  Passive sniffing involves only listening and is usually implemented in networks connected by hubs.
        - Active
            - Active sniffing techniques include spoofing attacks, DHCP attacks, and DNS poisoning among others.

    -ARP Poisoning
        - The Address Resolution Protocol is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address. This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite

    - packet sniffing means eavesdropping on other people's conversations.
