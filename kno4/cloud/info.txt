- dedicated server
    one physical machine dedicated to single a business, runs a single web-app/site.

- Virtual Private server
    one physical machine dedicated to single a business, the physical machine is Virtualized into sub-machines, runs a multiple web-app/site.

- Shared server
    one physical machine, shared by hundred of businesses, relis on most tenants under-utilizing their resources.

-Cloud Hosting
    multiple physical machines that act as one system. The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services.

- A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is a company which provides multiple Cloud Server, and those Cloud Services can be chained together to create cloud architectures.

- cloud architectures:

    - Virtual private cloud (VPC)

    - computer engine : run the web app on

    - cloud storage (storage assets)

    - cloud SQL : database

    - cloud CDN (Content delivery network) cache commonly

    - cloud deployment manager : mechanism to deploy the application

    - DialogFlow : having a conversational ai

- G-suite = Google Apps = Google Workspace (SAAS)
    is a collection of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools, software and products developed and marketed by Google.
