Clarification:
How many stocks to be given out? -> let's say x

Design of A/B Experiment
Variable under test: number of new accounts created
Goal: Increase the number of new accounts created using a campaign giving out x free stocks
Control group: campaign with no free stocks given to new users
Treatment group: campaign with x free stocks to new users
Hypothesis:
H0: There is no difference in the number of new users acquired in the control and treatment group
H1: There is a difference in the number of new users acquired in the control and treatment group
Metrics:
Primary: Number of new users acquired through each campaign
Secondary: Daily active users, the average number of trades per user per day
Statistics of experiment:
Significance level: 0.05 -> type I error
Power of test: 0.8
Effect size: depends on the market size. Assuming the US market, a 1% change would be significant.
Determine sample size
Unit of test: Users in the same geographic location
Number of days to run the experiment: sample size/number of customers reached each day during the campaign
