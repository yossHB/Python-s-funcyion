Different types of testing
    Unit tests
        tests only test a single part of your implementation.

    integration tests
        testing the interface between two software units or module.
            Big-Bang Integration Testing:
                put together and tested
            Bottom-Up Integration Testing:
                each module at lower levels is tested with higher modules until all modules are tested.
            Top-Down Integration Testing:
                to simulate the behaviour of the lower-level modules that are not yet integrated.
            Mixed Integration Testing:

    functional tests
        Functional tests look at the app from the user's point of view and test that the system works as expected.
