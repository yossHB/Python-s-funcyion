- Angular is a front-end JavaScript framework. 
- A framework is a set of connected libraries designed around a specific programming language.
- TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.
- MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node)
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP)
- Python-Django
- Ruby on Rails
- .NET   The .NET Framework is a proprietary software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It was the predominant implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure until being superseded by the cross-platform .NET project.
- TS Flights back-end will have these main responsibilities:
    - Handle requests from the front-end for information
    - CRUD   Create, Read, Update and Delete plane flights in the system
    - Send info back to the front-end in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation)
- In web applications, this typically comes in the form of an XML/HTTP Request or an XHR.  request / response 
- HTTP error status codes are:
    - 404 (not found)
    - 403 (forbidden)
    - 401 (not authorized)
    - 500 (internal server error)
    - 503 (service unavailable)
- HTTP Success Codes
    - 200 (ok)
    - 201 (created)
    - 202 (accepted), etc.
- 400 level status codes generally indicate an issue with the request itself, and 500 level status codes generally indicate an error on the back-end.
-------
If the initial request has been accepted by the web application server, and there is a need to retrieve data related to the request, the web application server then queries a database or databases to get the information needed to send back to the user.

The database sends the result of the query back to the web application server, and then the web application server usually formats the data into a format to be sent back to the front-end. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a very common format currently used to send data to clients (the front-end).
--------
- HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: Informational responses (100–199), Successful responses (200–299), Redirects (300–399), Client errors (400–499), and Server errors (500–599). 
- A simplified typical data flow from back to front would be:
    1. Data retrieved from database query
    2. Data routed through server
    3. Data reaches service
    4. Data reaches component
    5. Data reaches view
- Generating an Angular Service: we write methods that export data out of the service
- Dependency injection is a common design pattern in object oriented programming.
- The [()] construct in Angular enables two way data binding. Some developers call this the "banana in a box".
- A component encapsulate the data, html markup and the logic for a view.
    - An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
    - A Typescript class that defines behavior
    - A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template
    - Optionally, CSS styles applied to the template
